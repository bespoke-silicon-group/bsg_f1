# Hardware

This directory HDL sources, ROM scripts, and Verilog package files for
building the BSG Manycore Architecture on F1.

## Contents

This directory contains the following files:

- `Makefile`: Targets for building generated HDL source files.

The hardware source files in this directory have self-contained
descriptions of their use.
